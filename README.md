# PhonetiNet: Visualising Phonetic Distance Between Languages

This library features tools for generating network maps of phonetic distance between langauges:

1. 'Phonetic_Distance.R' calculates the overlap between phonetic features between language pairs as a percentage of the number of unique phonetic features across both languages.

2. 'Optimal_Edge_Width.R' calculates the optimal edge width cutoff to enhance network map readability by keeping edge number low, while ensuring that all nodes are connected to 
at least one other node.
